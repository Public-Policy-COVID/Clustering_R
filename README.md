# Clustering_R
clustering: partitioning (Bryn Bandt-Law) + hierarchizing (Nick Maue)
Partitioning: We will request a particular number of clusters to the algorithm and the algorithm will put each case in a cluster. 
Hierarchizing:Hierarchizing: The algorithm find all of the possible ways cases can be clustered individually and in subgroups via a tree-construction/deconstruction approach. 

individually and in subgroups following a tree-construction/deconstruction approach.
